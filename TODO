BUGS
----

fal:
  Reports of problems with FAL on DECnet/E. Need to test with new 
  RSX-friendly code.

phone:
  Race condition in ANSWER where you can get the message "no-one is calling
    you now" when there is. Only happens with "phone answer" on the shell
    command line. Only happens rarely (to me!).

  initial command to phone ignores params. eg;
       phone dir a11rtr:: 
    thinks you just typed "dir" cos it ignores argv[2]

  Don't think it works to non-VMS machines

libdnet:
  Need a better function doing dnet_conn(), maybe we should provide one
  opening a listen socket, too.

ph3-der-loewe's private list:
  Add ckport database.

  Remove/Merge debian/templates (into debian/dnet-common.templates).

  Make setting up of MAC address at runtime more easy.
   - ARP spoof to send new MAC addresses to other hosts on the network.
   - Maybe find a nice way to get stuff with DHCP working better.
   - Write old MAC address to logfile (at install time) so it can be reconstructed
     later. See DEB#635604 (some cards are broken).

  Upgrade libdnet-dev from extra to optional.

  Merge and update debian/*.copyright.
