.SH NAME
rmtermd  \- Old style DECnet terminal services for Linux  

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rmtermd 
.br
[options]
.br
Options:
.br
[\-dvVh] [\-l logtype]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Allows remote PDP-11 users to connect as a terminal over DECnet.
.br
 
.br
This application implements the DTERM protocol over DECnet for allowing a 
remote DECnet host emulating a DEC VT100 terminal to connect to
Linux.  DTERM is the old OS-dependent network terminal protocol that
predates CTERM; it is needed to support access from PDP-11 systems,
which do not support CTERM.  Note that this daemon implements the
TOPS-20 variant of that protocol; the client at the other end has to
speak that version.  For example, under DECnet/E (for RSTS/E) you have 
to use the "unsupported" multi-protocol version of "set host".
.br

.br
Normally this daemon will be run from dnetd(8) rather than by hand.
