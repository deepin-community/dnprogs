.TP
.I "\-e <char>"
Set the exit character. By default this is ^]. You can specify the exit character as a
control character by preceding it with a circumflex eg (^A means control-A) or as 
a number in decimal (default), octal (starting with a zero), or hexadecimal (preceded
by 0x or 0X).
.TP
.I \-h \-?

.br

.br
.PP
    sethost mv3100
.br

.SH HELPFUL HINTS
The CTERM specifications available from Digital does not include how to setup 
VMS terminal characteristics, so the host cannot identify the capabilities of
the session we are creating. The simplest workaround is to set the terminal
capabilities manually upon login or including the following command in the
.B login.com 
DCL procedure.

.B $ SET TERM/DEC_CRT
