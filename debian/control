Description: Base package for Linux DECnet
 This is the base package for Linux DECnet. It contains the necessary
 configuration files and a script to set up the MAC address of your
 Ethernet card(s) at boot-up.
 .
 You will also need to be running a 2.4+ kernel and have DECnet either
 built as a module or compiled into the kernel.
 .
 To do useful work with DECnet you will need the libdnet package and
 probably also dnet-progs.

Section: libs
Description: DECnet Libraries
 This package contains the libraries necessary for a functioning DECnet
 system. Most DECnet programs require these libraries to be present on
 the system. The libraries are:
 libdnet        - the basic DECnet API as featured on Ultrix(R) systems
 libdnet_daemon - useful calls for writing DECnet daemons
 libdap         - DAP (Data Access Protocol) C++ classes
 librms         - High level library for programmatic access VMS files
                  from Linux.
 .
 To do useful work with DECnet you will also need the dnet-common
 package.
 .
 If you're looking for libdnet, the "dumb" networking library from
 libdnet.sf.net by Dug Song then you should install libdumbnet instead.
 Sorry for any confusion caused!
