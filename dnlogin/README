This is a replacement for the rather unwieldy sethost program. It is pretty much
in a usable state now (though only tested to VMS), any additions/fixes/bug 
reports are welcome.

The principle is that found.c implements the foundation protocol in found.txt
and cterm.c implements the cterm protocol on top of that, and the tty handling
happens in tty.c.

It should be easy to plug in other terminal protocols into here (eg dterm)
if/when someone volunteers them.
