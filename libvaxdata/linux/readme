Three makefiles have been provided for Linux:

   makefile.gcc    GNU C (gcc)
   makefile.icc    Intel C (icc)
   makefile.pgcc   Portland Group C (pgcc)

To create libvaxdata.a from here:

   # make -f makefile.xxx [ all | libvaxdata | clean ]

substituting gcc, icc, or pgcc for xxx.  The default make target is all.
The library and all object files will be written to a subdirectory named
for the system architecture returned by "uname -m".

To link a C program with the library:

   # xxx -o program program.o -lvaxdata -Lhere/arch

substituting gcc, icc, or pgcc for xxx, and the path to the library for
here/arch (assuming it has not been moved or copied somewhere else).

To link a Fortran program with the library, substitute g77, ifort, or pgf77
(pgf90, pgf95) for xxx, plus the path to the library for here/arch.
