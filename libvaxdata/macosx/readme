Two makefiles have been provided for Mac OS X:

   makefile.gcc    GNU C (gcc)
   makefile.xlc    IBM XL C (xlc)

To create libvaxdata.a from here:

   # make -f makefile.xxx [ all | libvaxdata | clean ]

substituting gcc or xlc for xxx.  The default make target is all.  The
library and all object files will be written to a subdirectory named for
the system architecture returned by "uname -p".

To link a C program with the library:

   # xxx -o program program.o -lvaxdata -Lhere/arch

substituting gcc or xlc for xxx, and the path to the library for here/arch
(assuming it has not been moved or copied somewhere else).

To link a Fortran program with the library, substitute g77 or xlf (xlf90,
xlf95) for xxx, plus the path to the library for here/arch.
