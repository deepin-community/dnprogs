Two makefiles have been provided for Tru64 Unix:

   makefile.gcc    GNU C (gcc)
   makefile.cc     DEC/Compaq/HP C (cc)

To create libvaxdata.a from here:

   # make -f makefile.xxx [ all | libvaxdata | clean ]

substituting gcc or cc for xxx.  The default make target is all. The
library and all object files will be written to a subdirectory named
for the system architecture returned by "uname -p".

To link a C program with the library:

   # xxx -o program program.o -lvaxdata -Lhere/arch

substituting gcc or cc for xxx, and the path to the library for here/arch
(assuming it has not been moved or copied somewhere else).

To link a Fortran program with the library, substitute g77 or f77 (f90,
f95) for xxx, plus the path to the library for here/arch.
