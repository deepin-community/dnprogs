An OpenVMS command procedure has been provided to compile libvaxdata on either
OpenVMS/VAX or OpenVMS/Alpha using DEC/Compaq/HP C.

To create libvaxdata.o from here:

   $ @make [ all | libvaxdata | clean ]

The default make target is all.  The library and all object files will be
written to a subdirectory named for the system architecture returned by the
DCL lexical function F$GetSYI( "ARCH_NAME" ).

To link a C program with the library:

   $ Link program,[here.arch]libvaxdata/Library

substituting the path to the library for here.arch (assuming it has not been
moved or copied somewhere else).
